# paramotor


## Purpose
Building a public editable knowledge base of paramotor related information.

This is not a replacement of existing repositories of knowledge like usppa.org
or southwestairsports.com, but rather an aggregation point of those resources
 and a more structured pilot driven content repository than the mess that is
 Facebook.  

### Specific Goals
