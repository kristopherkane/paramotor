# The Paramotor Knowledgebase


## Purpose
Building a public editable knowledge base of paramotor related information. 

This is not a replacement of existing repositories of knowledge like usppa.org
or southwestairsports.com, but rather an aggregation point of those resources
 and a more structured pilot driven content repository than the mess that is
 Facebook.  


## Why GitHub? 
It is what I use every day for work.  GitHub hosting is free, incudes simple markdown formatting or GitHub Pages and a way for people to propose changes to the documents.
